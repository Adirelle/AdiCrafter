# AdiCrafter

This mod adds only one block: the automated crafter.

The automated crafter pulls ingredients from neighboring containers and inventories, including chests, hopper and other
automated crafters, and any other blocks that implements the Fabric transfer API.

### Configuration

You can select the recipe to craft by opening the configuration screen. Simply right-click (use) the block.

Edit the crafting grid on the left. The result of any valid recipe will show on the middle slot, and the right slot can
be used to manually craft the recipe.

Note that the right slot will not show anything if there is no enough ingredients available.

### Activation

The automated crafter will not craft anything unless you try to pull some items from it. You can do so manually, or by
using other item extracting blocks, like the hopper.

Right now, it does not need any from of energy or fuel, but that might change in the future, as this is just an alpha
version.

### Fuzzy mode

By default, the automated crafter tries to find the exact items used in its crafting grid, but the "fuzzy" option allows
to use any compatible items, e.g. using any kind of plank to craft a chest.

### Fluid substitution

There is also an option to replace anything fluid container items (buckets, bottles, ...) by pulling fluids from
neighboring tanks, like cauldrons.

This is of limited use with vanilla minecraft, but it can become handy with third-party mods that add a lot of new
fluids and recipe.
